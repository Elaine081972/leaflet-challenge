This assignment provides a new set of tools for the United States Geological Survery (USGS). The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply relevant information about the Earth and its processes. 

The new set of tools for the USGS involves developing program that will visualize their earthquake data.
This allows a meaningful way to display the massive amount of data they collect around the world each day, which
will help better educate the public and other government organizations on this issue we face.
